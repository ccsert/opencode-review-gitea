Fetch incremental diff for a pull request, only showing changes since the last review.

This tool is useful for reviewing updated PRs where you only want to see new changes, avoiding re-reviewing already reviewed code.

## How it works

1. Fetches all commits in the PR
2. Finds the last review submitted by this bot (via commit_id in reviews)
3. Returns only the diff for commits added after the last review

## When to use

- When a PR has been updated with new commits
- When you want to avoid duplicate review comments
- For large PRs that are incrementally reviewed

## Output

Returns:
- If no previous review: full PR diff
- If PR was rebased/force-pushed: full PR diff with warning
- Otherwise: incremental diff since last reviewed commit

## Parameters

- owner: Repository owner
- repo: Repository name
- pull_number: Pull request number
- format: "parsed" (default) for line-numbered format, "raw" for unified diff
