Fetch the diff (code changes) for a Gitea/Forgejo pull request.

This tool retrieves file changes in a PR with line numbers for review.

Features:
- Supports file filtering with glob patterns (e.g., "*.ts", "src/**/*.go")
- Two output formats: parsed (with line numbers) or raw (unified diff)

Output formats:
- "parsed" (default): Shows each line with line number prefix for easy reference when creating review comments
- "raw": Returns the raw unified diff format

The parsed format shows:
- [NEW:42] +new line  - Added line at line 42 in new file (use `line: 42` in comments)
- [OLD:38] -old line  - Deleted line at line 38 in old file (use `old_line: 38` in comments)
- [NEW:42]  context   - Unchanged context line (use `line: 42` in comments)

File filtering examples:
- ["*.ts", "*.tsx"] - Only TypeScript files
- ["src/**"] - Only files in src directory

When creating review comments with gitea-review tool:
- For [NEW:X] lines → use `line: X`
- For [OLD:X] lines → use `old_line: X`
