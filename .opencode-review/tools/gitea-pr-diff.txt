Fetch the diff (code changes) for a Gitea/Forgejo pull request.

This tool retrieves file changes in a PR with line numbers for review.

Features:
- Supports file filtering with glob patterns (e.g., "*.ts", "src/**/*.go")
- Two output formats: parsed (with line numbers) or raw (unified diff)

Output formats:
- "parsed" (default): Shows each line with [LINE_NUM] prefix for easy reference when creating review comments
- "raw": Returns the raw unified diff format

The parsed format shows:
- [42] +new line  - Added line at line 42
- [DEL] -old line - Deleted line
- [42]  context   - Unchanged context line

File filtering examples:
- ["*.ts", "*.tsx"] - Only TypeScript files
- ["src/**"] - Only files in src directory
- ["!*.test.ts"] - Exclude test files (not supported, use positive patterns)

Use the line numbers in [brackets] when creating review comments with gitea-review tool.
