Submit a code review on a Gitea/Forgejo pull request.

This tool submits a review with:
1. A summary/report (AI-generated, displayed as the main review body)
2. Line-level comments attached to specific code lines
3. An approval decision (approve/comment/request_changes)

**IMPORTANT**: The `summary` parameter should contain a complete, well-formatted review report. 
The tool does NOT auto-generate content - you control the entire output.
