Submit a code review on a Gitea/Forgejo pull request.

This tool allows you to:
- Post a summary review comment
- Add line-level comments on specific code changes (both new and deleted lines)
- Approve, request changes, or just comment

Use this tool after analyzing a PR's code changes to provide structured feedback.

## Line Comment Types

Comments support two targeting modes based on the diff output format:

1. **New/Context lines** (marked `[NEW:X]` in diff): use `line: X`
2. **Deleted lines** (marked `[OLD:X]` in diff): use `old_line: X`

## Example Usage

```json
{
  "owner": "org",
  "repo": "project", 
  "pull_number": 42,
  "summary": "Good changes overall, one security concern.",
  "comments": [
    {
      "path": "src/auth.ts",
      "line": 25,
      "body": "Consider using bcrypt for password hashing"
    },
    {
      "path": "src/legacy.ts",
      "old_line": 18,
      "body": "This validation logic was important, ensure it's preserved elsewhere"
    }
  ],
  "approval": "request_changes"
}
```

The comments will appear in the PR's "Files Changed" tab at the specified line numbers.
