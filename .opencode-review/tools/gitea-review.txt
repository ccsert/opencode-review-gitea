Submit a code review on a Gitea/Forgejo pull request.

This tool allows you to:
- Post a summary review comment
- Add line-level comments on specific code changes
- Approve, request changes, or just comment

Use this tool after analyzing a PR's code changes to provide structured feedback.

Example usage:
- Review a PR with approval: provide summary, comments array, and set approval to "approve"
- Request changes: provide specific comments on problematic lines and set approval to "request_changes"
- General feedback: provide comments with approval as "comment" (default)

The comments will appear in the PR's "Files Changed" tab at the specified line numbers.
